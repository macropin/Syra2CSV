Missing features:

Caveat: Doesn't handle reseller credit transfers correctly. Eg when you purchase credit with credit card. 
I think this needs to be handled with two transactions. a) Create a COGS purchase of credit b) manual transfer from unknown to Syra account, of the amount less the transaction / credit card fee.

.... but since it works well enough for our needs, these might never get written.
